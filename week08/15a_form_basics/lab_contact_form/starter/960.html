Let's set up a few 960 Grid layouts!

/**
 * Question 1:
 * Set up a header in HTML and set it to a 12 column grid. (Set up the row; do not set up the columns.)
 */
 


/**
 * Question 2:
 * Insider the header row, create a 2 column layout. Set the left column to span 3 grids and use the remainder for the right column.
 */



/**
 * Question 3:
 * Place a logo image (use logo.png) in the left column and for extra credit add a site search input and button on the right side.
 */



/**
 * Question 4: 
 * Add a wrapper div under the header and set it to a 12 column grid. (Repeat your header code below.)
 */



/**
 * Question 5:
 * Inside the wrapper div, create a 3 column layout.
 */



/**
 * Question 6:
 * Under the wrapper div, create a footer, set it to 12 columns, and include a div that spans 12 columns.
 */



/**
 * Question 7:
 * For extra credit, remove the left and right margin from the div inside of the footer.
 */
